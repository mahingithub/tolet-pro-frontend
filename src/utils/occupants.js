 * occupants.js
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for "who is actually living in this booking, and how
 * many of them are there".
 *
 * THE BUG THIS FILE REPLACES
 * Two different fields were being read as if they were the answer, and neither
 * one was:
 *
 *   booking.tenantsCount — a number the landlord types ONCE on the New Lease
 *     form. It is never updated when a seat is filled or vacated, and bookings
 *     created from a room (placeTenantInUnit) never set it at all. A hostel
 *     room with two occupants therefore rendered "1 Tenant", because
 *     `undefined || 1` is 1. The card contradicted the seat list inside it.
 *
 *   booking.tenant — the name typed at lease creation. For a SEAT building the
 *     server deliberately leaves it EMPTY (`tenant: isSeat ? '' : input.name`),
 *     because a hostel room has no single tenant. The card then showed no name
 *     at all, and there was no way to tell who was in the room without opening
 *     it. It also goes stale on flats: when a tenant joins with the invite code
 *     they become a member, and members[] is what every other screen reads.
 *
 * THE RULE
 * members[] is the occupancy record. It is the same array the rent ledger, the
 * capacity check and the tenant app all read, so anything derived from it can't
 * disagree with them. `tenantsCount` / `tenant` survive ONLY as the fallback
 * for legacy bookings that have no members[] at all.
 *
 * CAPACITY IS SEATS, NOT HEADS — mirrors seatsTaken() in the backend's
 * tenancy.service.js. One member row with seatsBooked = 4 fills a 4-seat room
 * by itself; counting heads there reports free seats that do not exist.
 */

/**
 * "Every occupant of this room", said out loud.
 *
 * Documents are produced for ONE person — their name, their rent share, their
 * NID — so every download surface takes a member. A landlord printing the whole
 * room needs to say "all of them" through that same parameter, and the
 * alternative was inventing a fake member object to stand for the group, which
 * every reader of `member.name` would then have to defend itself against.
